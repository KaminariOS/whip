# README screenshot mockups

The WebP files in this directory are Pixel 9 Pro screenshots wrapped in the
front-facing Pixel 9 Pro frame from
[`@sneas/telephone`](https://github.com/sneas/telephone). The frame is used

To replace the screenshots, capture each screen at 960×2142, place it in this
directory with the corresponding `.png` name, then run:

```sh
nix develop -c npm run generate:readme-phone-mockups
```

If you are replacing one screen, pass its base name after `--`, for example:

```sh
nix develop -c npm run generate:readme-phone-mockups -- hosts
```

The generator creates a 706×1490 WebP at quality 92 with lossless alpha, then
removes the source PNG. It rejects screenshots at any other size so an
accidental second run cannot nested-frame the output.
